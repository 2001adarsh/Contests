/*
Gold Grid
an Nâˆ—N grid. Each square in the grid either has or does not have a gold coin. He has to divide the gamefield with his three other friends as follows: he will draw one horizontal line and one vertical line to divide the field into four rectangles. His friends will choose three of the four smaller fields and he gets the last one.

He wants to divide the field so that he gets the maximum number of goldcoins, assuming that his friends will pick the best three rectangles.
