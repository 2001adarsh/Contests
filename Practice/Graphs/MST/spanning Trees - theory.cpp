//Spanning Trees.
/*
The spanning trees are the graph which connects all the vertices with min.
number of edges.
The no. of edges in a spanning trees are |V|-1, V is the no. of vertices.

    The number of spanning trees that can be formed of E edges and V vertices
    containing 'n' cycles

     => |E|C(combination)|V-1| - 'n'
